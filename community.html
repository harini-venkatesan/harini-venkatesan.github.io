      <h2>Community & Leadership</h2>
      <div class="women-computing-content">
        <p>I am deeply committed to supporting and advancing underrepresented groups in computing. As a woman in a field that has historically been male-dominated, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities that come with pursuing a career in computer science, and I'm passionate about creating ways for others like me to have access to as many resources as possible. I believe that people from different backgrounds bring unique perspectives to problem-solving and skills that enrich the learning community.</p>
                
        <h3>Leadership & Community Building</h3>
        <p>I have been actively involved in creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in computing during my undergraduate and graduate studies at UCR:</p>
