      <h2>Community & Leadership</h2>
      <div class="women-computing-content">
        <p>I am deeply committed to supporting and advancing underrepresented groups in computing. As a woman in a field that has historically been male-dominated, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities that come with pursuing a career in computer science, and I'm passionate about creating ways for others like me to have access to as many resources as possible. I believe that people from different backgrounds bring unique perspectives to problem-solving and skills that enrich the learning community.</p>
                
        <h3>Leadership & Community Building</h3>
        <p>I have been actively involved in creating opportunities for underrepresented groups in computing during my undergraduate and graduate studies at UCR:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rose Hack Co-Founder & Director:</strong> Helped create and organized <a href="https://www.rosehack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose Hack</a>, UCR's first women-centric hackathon, providing a supportive environment for women and non-binary students to explore technology and build innovative projects. </li>
          <li><strong>Women in Computing (WINC) at UCR:</strong> Active member and graduate student leader in <a href="https://winc.cs.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WINC</a>, working to create a supportive community for women in computer science through networking events, mentorship programs, and professional development opportunities. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Mentorship & Support</h3>
        <p>Through my teaching, research, and community involvement, I actively work to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mentor undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds in computer science, providing guidance on both technical skills and career development</li>
          <li>Create inclusive classroom environments that encourage participation from all students, regardless of background or identity</li>
          <li>Advocate for equal opportunities and recognition in research, teaching, and industry</li>
          <li>Organize events and programs that specifically support underrepresented groups in technology</li>
        </ul>
