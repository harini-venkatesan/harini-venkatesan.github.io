      <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UC Riverside with a passion for both research and teaching. 
            My research focuses on developing novel multi-fidelity inference techniques using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and normalizing flows 
            to leverage low-fidelity approximations, working in collaboration with UCR's Physics and Astronomy department to approximate posteriors using computationally expensive simulations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an Associate Instructor, I am currently teaching CS 006 (Effective Use of World Wide Web) to over 100 students covering web tools, e-communities, e-commerce, generative AI, and verification of information, privacy, and other legal and societal issues.
            I also taught CS 009A (Intro to Programming and Data Science) to over 100 students covering computational thinking, problem-solving, and data analysis using the Python language.
          </p>
          <p>
            I previously served as a Teaching Assistant for Machine Learning, Data Mining and Object-Oriented Programming courses, assisting over 500 students total.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>
      <div class="research-content">
        <p>My research focuses on developing innovative multi-fidelity methods for probabilistic inference, with particular emphasis on recursive multi-level approaches that can approximate complex, real-world distributions more efficiently than traditional methods.</p>
        
        <h3>Current Research Focus</h3>
        <p>I'm working on extending Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to solve the challenging problem of proposal function selection, especially in high-dimensional and computationally expensive simulations. This work has direct applications to astronomy and hydrology, where we need to efficiently sample from complex probability distributions that describe physical models of the universe, for instance. I have developed extensive convergence rates for these methods as well as established empirical and theoretical hyperparameter selection</p>
        
        <h3>Collaborative Work</h3>
        <p>I collaborate closely with researchers in UCR's Physics and Astronomy department to apply these methods to real and complex problems. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to work at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and astronomy, developing solutions that are both theoretically sound and practically useful.</p>

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <div class="teaching-content">
        <p>I am passionate about making computer science accessible and engaging for students from all backgrounds. My teaching philosophy is grounded in the belief that active learning fosters deeper understanding and long-term retention of core concepts and foundations. In entry level programming courses, I emphasize collaborative problem-solving, hands-on activities, and use live coding demonstrations to model the thought process behind programming. In more advanced machine learning courses, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and practice by incorporating real-world datasets and applications, which allow students to see the relevance of methods beyond abstract concepts.</p>
